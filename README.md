I added some OpenGL files, because I couldn't upload them to my new repository for some reason, couldn't get the upload file button to appear no matter what I tried.

This is the HelloTriangle example from Microsoft's DirectX 12 samples on Github.
It has been modified to display a large vertex buffer of a triangle list on the screen.
There are two groups of triangles (particles), one green and one blue.
Enjoy.  There is much more to come.

How to use:

Install Visual Studio 2015

Download the Microsoft DirectX 12 Samples

In the HelloWorld (any project in that solution):
copy/paste the code from the .cpp and .h provided here to the hello****.cpp and hello****.h files in the project, then compile and run.

Note: If you just want to download the .exe and the .hlsl file (shaders) that will run on it's own for you.

Please let me know what you think, and if you want to see more, and what specifically you would like to see.
